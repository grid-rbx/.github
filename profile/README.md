## Hi there 👋

We are Grid, a company devoted to help you manage your super awesome Roblox experiences in production. We've had the idea to do this for **2 years** but have only started working on it now. Crazy, isn't it? Since then, we have come up with countless ways to help you and your team manage your experiences on Roblox, and now we are nearing closer than ever to launching. 

We hope you're along for the ride 🚀

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
